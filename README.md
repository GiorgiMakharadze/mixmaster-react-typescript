# Project Title

## MixMaster

## Description

This project is a web-based application designed using the latest and powerful features of React. It is primarily based on the open API provided by TheCocktailDB, which can be found here.

## Used Technologies

In this build, I used React, React Router 6.4, React Query, Axios, Styled-components, etc.

## Features

This application is built on the following main technologies:

1. React Router 6.4: We are using the brand new features provided by React Router 6.4, the latest version of the popular routing library in React. React Router 6.4 brings along several new features and enhancements which have been utilized in this project.

2. React Query: React Query is a robust and powerful data synchronization library for React that makes working with server state as easy as managing local state. It handles caching, background updates, and stale data out of the box with zero-configuration.

## How to install

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies by running npm install or yarn
3. Start the application by running npm start or yarn start
